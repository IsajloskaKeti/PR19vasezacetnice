Suicide rates overview 1985 to 2016

Facts about suicides
•	Men are far more prone to commiting suicide than women, or at least this is what the data shows.
•	Young people, adolescents in particular, are NOT at the greatest risk. See the charts below. These are only examples, but this general pattern comes up time and again.
•	There are considerable differences between countries even after age standardization. Recall the WHO map above.

The dataset consists of the number of suicides each year in a given country, split by sex and age groups, plus the total population in according group, thus allowing us to calculate the crude rates per 100k people.
The use of rates seems obvious, as the sheer number of suicides corresponds to the size of the population: the bigger the country, the more suicides. What is less obvious is that these rates - also called crude rates - do not allow for a proper comparison between countries. Suicide rates, as we shall see, vary considerably depending on demographic groups, so for a country as a whole one has to take into account its current demographic structure.
There are 3 dimensions: Health, Education and Standard of living and four indications:
Dimension	Indicator	Minimum	Maximum
Health	Life expectancy (years)	20	85
Education	Expected years of schooling(years)	0	18
	Mean years of schooling(years)	0	15
Standard of living	Gross national income per capita (2011 PPP $)	100	75.000

The HDI (Humann Development Index) is the geometric mean of the three dimensional indices: 
HDI = (IHealth*IEducation*IIncome) 1/3
-	We have to compare socio-economic info with suicide rates by year and country
